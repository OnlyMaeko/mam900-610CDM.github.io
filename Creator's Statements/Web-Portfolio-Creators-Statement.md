Website Creator's Statement

For my website I am creating a site to promote my professional portfolio. I am an information science student and have done many projects that I would like recruiters to see along with my resume which I will also put there. I want to highlight specific projects that I'd likely be talking about in job interviews. My primary target will be job recruiters and interviews and I would even go as far to say as I may possibly pull up the website to open my projects and to make them readily accessible when having a conversation. 

I want the reader to start on the homepage where my headshot, linkedin, and introduction are available. I want the reader to be able to click through pages to come to my project page where they will find a broad overview of the projects I feel are representative of my talents.

I think that I possessed the skills to do the project before the class but the application was very meaningful because I needed one. This allowed me to go a little further and put my website on the internet where it is accessible and I think it is a good culmination of the class because each individual project is a nice application of a skill but being able to present what Iâ€™ve done is one of the most important skills I've developed and I think this project helps bring that out the most because I have some background in making functional websites.
