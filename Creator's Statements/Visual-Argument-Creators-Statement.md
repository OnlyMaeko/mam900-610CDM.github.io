Visual Argument:

(Sources): For my information I used the department of Nuclear Energy as well as the Energy Information Administration (.gov) to collect the information to craft my ideas.
To actually create the images I used generative AI chat-gpt with very specifically crafted statements on 10/21/24, 10/23/24, 10/26/24 to create the parts of my visual argument. I will list the statements I input to generate the images for my project. (I did this because I'm not the best drawer and I was having a very difficult time finding images that exactly described want I wanted because none of them included statistics or were royalty free. I believe that I stayed within the class guidelines posted on the syllabus and definitely don't want to stray outside of them, so if I did anything outside the allowed guidelines please let me know.)

I'm trying to create a comparison between coal and nuclear and showing that one is much more efficient. To do so I'm using batteries to represent the efficiency of the conversion from raw fuel to electricity and "charge" of the battery is how efficient the generation is. The message that I'm trying to get across is that nuclear energy is incredibly efficient and that only 7 percent is wasted as heat energy that affects the environment.

While it is a highly discussed topic I don’t think many people understand the finer details of the pros/cons. The context surrounding this is a large amount of opinion based on a relatively small pool of information that people are exposed to combined with known negative effects of radiation when in contact with humans. My target audience is people who are not educated about the possibilities that revamping America’s nuclear infrastructure holds. I think most people’s attitudes will be somewhat negative and fearful as the consequences of disaster are very high. However the risk of disaster is very low which is the point I want to elaborate on. I think people’s main concern isn’t that nuclear energy is bad in the way coal energy is but rather that it’s directly unsafe to people whereas burning fossil fuels is an indirect way of damaging humans.

My design choices heavily favored a direct contrast of the two plants side by side. I wanted there to only be two elements that you look towards at first which are the batteries. That why I choose bright colors and I set them far apart from each other. I also chose an even number of elements in the frame (4) so there would be nothing in the middle to fixate on. I really want to create a clear divide between the two plants and used symbols of coal and radioactive symbol to assign the plants an identity. I think that completes the ANTI CRAP analysis but I also selected the background to be dark colors so the plants are brighter by comparison but I also wanted to use the background to divide up the alignment of the plants and to really split the viewers focus.

Statements used to generate images: 
1. Make just a regular nuclear plant symbol on a completely transparent background
2. Make an identical image of the plant above with the same background color and lack of details but change it from a nuclear plant to a coal plant
3. make an identical image of this battery with the only changes being the number at the top is 33% and only 1/3 of the bars are green and the rest are red
4. using the same background as this last image create a photo of a cartoon battery that is vertical and is 93% charged use 15 bars and have 14 of them be green
5. Create an image of a cartoon nuclear reactor plant that looks very safe but powerful. Make the backgorund black, take away all words but have a little green on the plant, no sun or clouds
