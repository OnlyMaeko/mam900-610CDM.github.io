<h4>
My name is Marko Melishchuk and I am currently a student at the University of Pittsburgh double majoring in Information Science & Computational Social Science. I grew up in South Philadelphia and have recently finished my second IT internship with the City of Philadelphia.
<br>
<br>
The next part of my timeline is unclear but I would like to pursue a career in information science, project development, or data analytics to name a few options. 
Over the past two summers I have started on my professional path I interned with the City of Philadelphia in their Licensing and Inspections department as a GIS data analyst, as well as in the Office of Innovation and Technology's project management office. 
To work towards that I'm currently enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh and am taking courses in the Information Science core as well as the Computational Social Science core along with the part of the Computer Science core that I've already completed.
